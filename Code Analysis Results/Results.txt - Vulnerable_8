Examining Vulnerable_8.c

FINAL RESULTS:

Vulnerable_8.c:10:  [4] (buffer) scanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function.

Vulnerable_8.c:29:  [4] (buffer) scanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Specify a limit to %s, or use a different input function. If the scanf
  format is influenceable by an attacker, it's exploitable.

Vulnerable_8.c:7:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure
  that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.

Vulnerable_8.c:11:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure
  that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.

Vulnerable_8.c:23:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure
  that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.

Vulnerable_8.c:27:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure
  that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.

Vulnerable_8.c:28:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source
  has a constant maximum length.

Vulnerable_8.c:31:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Perform bounds checking, use functions that limit length, or ensure
  that the size is larger than the maximum possible length.
