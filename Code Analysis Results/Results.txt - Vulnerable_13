Examining Vulnerable_13.c

FINAL RESULTS:

Vulnerable_13.c:54:  [3] (random) srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related functions
  such as key and nonce creation (CWE-327).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] Use a more secure technique for acquiring random values.

Vulnerable_13.c:16:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] NO countermeasures,unless specified.

Vulnerable_13.c:84:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] NO countermeasures,unless specified.
