FINAL RESULTS:

Vulnerable_1.c:23:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
  pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Risk is low because the source is a
  constant string.
Vulnerable_1.c:24:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
  pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Risk is low because the source is a
  constant string.
