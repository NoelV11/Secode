Vulnerable_6.c:1451:  [5] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter
  appears to be a constant, instead of computing the number of characters
  left.
Vulnerable_6.c:1452:  [5] (buffer) _tcsncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, or

  to be a constant, instead of computing the number of characters left.
Vulnerable_6.c:1455:  [5] (buffer) MultiByteToWideChar:

  as characters.
