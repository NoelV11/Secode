Examining Vulnerable_12.c

FINAL RESULTS:

Vulnerable_12.c:27:  [2] (misc) open:
  Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks),
  force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move things
  around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its
  contents? (CWE-362).
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [+] NO countermeasures,unless specified.
