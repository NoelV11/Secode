Examining Vulnerable_2.c

FINAL RESULTS:

Vulnerable_2.c:16:  [5] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter
  appears to be a constant, instead of computing the number of characters
  left.
Vulnerable_2.c:17:  [5] (buffer) _tcsncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, or
  automatically resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter appears
  to be a constant, instead of computing the number of characters left.
Vulnerable_2.c:20:  [5] (buffer) MultiByteToWideChar:
  Requires maximum length in CHARACTERS, not bytes (CWE-120). Risk is high,
  it appears that the size is given as bytes, but the function requires size
  as characters.
Vulnerable_2.c:9:  [4] (buffer) _mbscpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using a function version that stops copying at the end
  of the buffer.
Vulnerable_2.c:12:  [4] (buffer) lstrcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
Vulnerable_2.c:5:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
Vulnerable_2.c:6:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
Vulnerable_2.c:10:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
Vulnerable_2.c:11:  [2] (buffer) CopyMemory:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
Vulnerable_2.c:13:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
  pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
Vulnerable_2.c:14:  [1] (buffer) _tcsncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
  pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
Vulnerable_2.c:15:  [1] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings.
Vulnerable_2.c:18:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
Vulnerable_2.c:22:  [1] (buffer) MultiByteToWideChar:
  Requires maximum length in CHARACTERS, not bytes (CWE-120). Risk is very
  low, the length appears to be in characters not bytes.
