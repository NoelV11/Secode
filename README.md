- Secode is an insecure Code Detector tool, that analyzes your code, to find anomalies, say Insecure Functions in your codes, that makee it insecure. 
- But, it doesn't stop there - as a precautionary measure, Secode provides you with safer function alternatives - like for the use of `strcpy()` which is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow,you must instead use secure alternative(s) like `lstrcy()`, that you can implement on your code, to make it secure.

# How is it different?
- Secode is powered by a **stringent and comprehensive ruleset**, that can detect vulnerabilities pretty easily, which will be updated regularly, 
as more vulnerabilities and exploits emerge.
- Secode enforces the concept of "**Secure Coding" and "Secure Software Devloepment Life Cycle (Secure SDLC)"** which is now gaining much needed traction during the 
development process of any software

## What does a Secode scan on the Code(s) you provide,give you?

Your Code Report provides you information about:-

- Hit count of vulnerable functions (total count)
- Vulnerability at hand
- CWE Number associated with it
- A brief description about the vulnerability
- Risk level of your code (graded from 1 - 5,on the severity basis)
- Secure alternative(s) that you must use which are totally safe from exploits.


## Installation Guide

Refer the INSTALL.md file for an in-depth walkthrough on how to install the tool,on your Linux distro

# Under the hood

More technically, secode uses lexical scanning to find tokens
(such as function names) that suggest likely vulnerabilities, estimates their
level of risk (e.g., by the text of function calls), and reports the results.
secode does not use or have access to information about control flow,
data flow, or data types.  Thus, secode will necessarily
produce many false positives for vulnerabilities and fail to report
many vulnerabilities.  On the other hand, secode can find
vulnerabilities in programs that cannot be built or cannot be linked.
secode also doesn't get as confused by macro definitions
and other oddities that more sophisticated tools have trouble with.

## Roadmap
- Dockerize it to provide support across all platforms
- Extending Scanning functionalities within the tool to: 
    1. Web Technologies like HTML, CSS, Js and PHP
    2. App Development languages like Java and Kotlin
- GitHub Actions workflows Integration.
